# uncomplicating_4nsible
This repo is dedicated to my projects and studies based on the amazing series Infra-as-Code Expert (by LinuxTips) and focused on Ansible. The purpose of this repo is to keep track of the changes and have more control over the code itself and expand on what the instructor is teaching.

## what you will need 

-> AWS Account
-> AWS Key and a profile configured on you machine
-> Basic Linux Knowledge
-> Python3/Ansible


## Copyright and Ownership
The code developed here does not substitute the training or is in any way trying to undermine or copy content from the course, its only a way to improve the way I am studying.

Thanks @badtuxx for the amazing course. ##VAIIII
